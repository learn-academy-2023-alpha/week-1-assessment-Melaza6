# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer: 

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a way to store code and share it with others in a local server, unlike Github which is a platform that uses git technology to allow you to store code and share it with their wide spread of clients in a safe cloud space. 

Researched answer: Git is use as a code repository and eventho git and Github have the same function, Github is used as a platform to upload copies of Git repository


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: ||(or), &&(and) and  === (strictly equal) within their functions.


Researched answer: Logical AND (&&); Logical OR(||); Logical NOT (!)

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: index is the place in which an element is located in an array. Elements in an array always start at a zero (0) index, unlike the value which reflects what the element in the array is. 

Researched answer: Index shows where an element is within an array, while the Value shows the element in the array.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: array and strings are similar because they both have an index indecator, but arrays can contain multiple strings

Researched answer: While arrays are a collection of data, strings are a collection of characters

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: pair programming is use to write code more effectively by having two (2) people work on the same code one would be the driver (the person writing the code) and the other person is consider the navigator (the person dictating the code that's being written) 

Researched answer: is a programmers technique in which two (2) programmers work together in the same workstation and constantly switching roles. the roles are driver: the onde writing the code and navigator: the one inspecting the code making sure there are not errors.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Are built-in methods in JavaScript that normally operate on arrays executing once in every element in an array.

2. Jest: is a JavaScript testing framework, it contains fractions of code funtionality often called dependencies and if use correct will allow us to test our code.

3. Objects: Are a JavaScript data type that contains a collection of key:value pairs, they may have information and actions making them the intesection of data and behavior.

4. Method: is a function that belongs to an object and are also a JavaScript keyword to call-in the object

5. Classes: are the blueprints of objects since they are a particular function that contains data and bahavior.
